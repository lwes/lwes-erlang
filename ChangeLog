* Thu Aug 20 2015 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 4.1.0
- recbuf now configurable (and defaults to the larger size)
- start at a journal_listener

* Tue Aug 18 2015 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 4.0.0
- improved code coverage significantly, which fixed some issues?
- various json formats were structured poorly
- if incoming packet already has ReceiptTime, SenderIP and SenderPort
at the end of the event, don't add them (to keep proxied events honest).
This breaks backward compatibility in case someone was relying on the
previous behavior which was that fields showed up twice.

* Thu Sep 20 2012 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 2.1.2
- hopefully last change, eep18 format should return a top-level tuple

* Thu Sep 20 2012 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 2.1.1
- did the last version too fast missed some cases where json was used

* Thu Sep 20 2012 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 2.1.0
- proplists was actually wrong as ejson requires eep18 and as that my
primary usecase for the json output, there are now 3 json decode formats
json will return mochijson2 struct format, json_proplist will return
the mochijson2 proplist formant, and json_eep18 will return the mochijson2
eep18 format

* Mon Aug 13 2012 Anthony Molinaro (djnym) 2.0.0
- switch to decoding as proplists, instead of struct's
- moved some files from mochiweb into lwes, so I could skip the dependency
- don't check return code of send so that it doesn't crash lwes if the network is down
